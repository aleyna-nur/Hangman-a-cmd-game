# Hangman-a-cmd-game
A word guessing game that can be played on the command prompt. Windows platform only.
The computer chooses a random word from the database (for Turkish: provided by @ekartal).
If guess is right, than no life points are used.
If guess is wrong, step-by-step, you are getting closer to hanging the man.
# How to make it work
In v0.1, you need to download Python 3 from python.org/downloads.
Then you can open the hangman.py with Python compiler to play the game.
